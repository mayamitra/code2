Yesterday, I went to the Zoo. The weather was foggy, so the meerkats were miserable. We ate fun zoo foods, like ice cream, and got to see the scary cobra. Everything was pretty normal, until a mountain goat worked out of their display and stole my egg. Then, it started cycling away. I couldn't believe it! We tried to chase after it, but it was too pink. I was so upset! I won't be coming to the zoo again.
