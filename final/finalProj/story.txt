Yesterday, I went to the Zoo. The weather was sunny, so the giraffes were sad. We ate fun zoo foods, like hummus, and got to see the scary penguin. Everything was pretty normal, until a monkey sat out of their display and stole my flower. Then, it started jumping away. I couldn't believe it! We tried to chase after it, but it was too pretty. I was so happy! I won't be coming to the zoo again.
